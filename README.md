## 🚀 About Me

I’m a cybersecurity-focused IT professional with over 2 years of hands-on experience in software engineering and test automation.

My background in QA, CI/CD pipelines, and secure development practices naturally evolved into a strong interest in:

- Application Security
- Threat Modeling
- Detection Engineering
- Secure SDLC
- Offensive security fundamentals

I recently defended my engineering thesis on **deepfake detection**, where I designed and trained neural network models (CNN, LSTM) to detect manipulated video content.

Cybersecurity is not just something I study — it’s the direction I’m actively building my career in.
